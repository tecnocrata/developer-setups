# Developer Setups

## Introduction

I have to admit that I never thought a day when I would create a setup for all the operating systems would come, but it is here, and the results are for sharing with you.

## Bash shell scripts

For some time Iâ€™ve been developing some scripts for personal use, these scripts are useful for setting up a new development environment from scratch

There are two flavors of them, one for macOS and another one for Ubuntu.

## Powershell scripts

These are the new kids on the block, and this work is based on this Slover's [gist recipe](https://gist.github.com/zloeber/9c2d659a2a8f063af26c9ba0285c7e78) which is constantly updated btw and in a less frequently updated yetanotherchris's [gist](https://gist.github.com/yetanotherchris/c51757d221eecb150867b7b113d227e8).

## Update frequency

I update them solely when I set up a new environment or when I want to register one modification for future installations.

Please feel free to report issues.

Thank you!
