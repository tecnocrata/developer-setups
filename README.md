# Bash shell scripts

For some time Iâ€™ve been developing some scripts for personal use, these scripts are useful for setting up a new development environment from scratch

There are two flavors of them, one for macOS and another one for Ubuntu.

I update them solely when I set up a new environment or when I want to register one modification for future installations.

Please feel free to report issues.

Thank you!
